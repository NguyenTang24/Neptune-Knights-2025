# Neptune-Knights-2025
All code for UCF MERKnight's MATE ROV Team, Neptune Knights.
This includes code for the ROV, control station, and Float.


## Overview
### ROV
A Raspberry Pi 5 on the ROV runs the BlueOS software. It is connected to a PixHawk 4 Flight Controller, running a customized version of stable ArduSub firmware. 

### Float
The float will be programmed with an ESP32 Microcontroller. The microcontroller will run a webserver that allows for controlling the float and viewing/downloading data.

### Control Station
The control station runs the latest version of Ubuntu 24.10. The BlueOS control software and camera control software will run in Electron apps.


# Installation
## For Development:
This will install all of the code in a GIT workspace on your computer. Only install everything if you will be working on development across the team. Otherwise, you only need to install relevant repostories.

Find instructions on adding an ssh key [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

```bash
mkdir "Neptune Knights 2025"
cd "Neptune Knights 2025"
mkdir src
git clone git@github.com:Neptune-Knights/Neptune-Knights-2025.git src
cd src
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

It is also recommended that you copy the contents of INFO/.bashrc into your .bashrc file or source the file.
Also, copy the contents of INFO/hosts into your /etc/hosts file:
```bash
sudo cat INFO/hosts >> /etc/hosts
```

## ROV Software (BlueOS, ArduPilot, and scripts):

BlueOS is the companion software to ArduPilot. It runs on the Raspberry Pi and can be accessed via the web browser on the control station on the same network. See below for how to install ArduPilot onto the flight controller from within BlueOS. 
** [BlueOS Installation](https://github.com/bluerobotics/BlueOS/tree/master/install) **
```bash
sudo su -c 'curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluerobotics/BlueOS/master/install/install.sh | bash'
```

### [ArduPilot](https://github.com/Neptune-Knights/ardupilot):
See the ArduPilot repo for how to compile the team's custom version of ArduSub.
Once a .apj file is compiled, it can be uploaded from within BlueOS. 
 
### [Cameras](https://github.com/Neptune-Knights/Neptune-Knights-2025/tree/main/ustreamer%20launch):
This setup launches four camera streams on the Pi using the ustreamer package.
 
## Control Station Setup:
The control station runs on the latest version of Ubuntu 24.10, though any modern Linux distro should work. Once Ubuntu and Google Chrome are installed, additional scripts/software can be used as follows.
[Camera Stream Viewr](https://github.com/Neptune-Knights/Neptune-Knights-2025/tree/main/stream%20viewer): An HTML file is dowloaded and opened in the web browser. 
BlueOS can be accessed in the web browser at the ROV's IP address, 192.168.0.100. No installation is needed on the control station.

[Hugin](https://hugin.sourceforge.io/) will be used for the photosphere task.
```bash
sudo apt install flatpak
flatpak install flathub net.sourceforge.Hugin
``` 
Integration with the Camera Stream Viewer is coming.

## Network Setup
Currently, the network is centered around a router in the control station. Any router that allows for custom IP mapping is sufficient. 
For our team, the following static IPs are used:
- Router: 192.168.0.1
- Control Station (hostname neptune): 192.168.0.101
- ROV (Raspberry Pi (hostname blueos, username pi)): 192.168.0.100


## Float:
